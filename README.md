## Installation, Use, Development

**TODO:** change random number bat to python file

All systems:

Open project in *Visual Studio Code* with installed *PlatformIO*, flash your teensy.

Install *python 3.7* at the moment of writing PyGame did not work with *3.8*
Run:
```pip install pygame```

At the time of writing version of *pygame* was *1.9.6*

``` pushd listener & python listener.py & popd```

This script runs untill you kill it. Now you can press buttons on the midi controller and the python script should react and LED's should work like on this video
